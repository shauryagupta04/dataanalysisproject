I imported the dataset from Kaggle using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Then, I used pandas to clean and process the data, removing redundant and duplicate entries and normalizing the dataset. After successfully processing the dataset, I connected to a SQL Server Database using an SQL Server connector to further analyze the data using SQL.
